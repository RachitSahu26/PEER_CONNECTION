You are a senior full-stack engineer and system architect.

Build a PRODUCTION-GRADE web application called **"Random Global Calling Platform"** where registered users can get randomly connected with another online user for a real-time AUDIO call.

STRICT REQUIREMENTS:

TECH STACK
- Frontend: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
- Backend: Node.js + Express + TypeScript
- Real-time: Socket.IO
- Calling: WebRTC (audio-only)
- Database: MongoDB (with Mongoose)
- Cache / Online users: Redis (mock Redis allowed if not available)
- Auth: JWT (email + password)
- Payments: Subscription logic (mock Stripe)
- Repo structure must be CLEAN and PROFESSIONAL

CORE FEATURES
1. User Authentication
   - Signup / Login
   - JWT-based auth
   - Protected routes

2. Online Presence System
   - Track online users via Socket.IO
   - Store online users in Redis (or in-memory abstraction with Redis-like interface)

3. Random Matchmaking
   - When user clicks "Connect", randomly pair them with another available online user
   - Prevent self-connection
   - Skip users who are already in a call
   - Use a queue or pool-based matchmaking strategy

4. Real-Time Audio Calling
   - Use WebRTC (audio only)
   - Implement signaling via Socket.IO
   - Proper handling of:
     - offer / answer
     - ICE candidates
     - call disconnect

5. Call Feedback System
   - After call ends, show feedback modal:
     - 👍 Like
     - 👎 Dislike
     - 🚩 Report
   - Store feedback in database
   - Maintain user reputation score

6. Abuse & Safety Logic
   - Block users with repeated bad feedback
   - Rate-limit calls per user
   - Auto-disconnect idle calls

7. Subscription System (Mock)
   - Free users:
     - Limited calls per day
     - Waiting time before match
   - Premium users:
     - Unlimited calls
     - Priority matching
   - Subscription logic only (no real payment required)

8. UI
   - Clean, modern UI
   - Pages:
     - Login / Signup
     - Dashboard (online users count)
     - Calling screen
     - Feedback modal
     - Profile (reputation + stats)

ARCHITECTURE & QUALITY
- Use modular folder structure
- Proper TypeScript types
- Comments explaining:
  - WebRTC flow
  - Socket.IO events
  - Matchmaking logic
- Error handling
- Environment variables
- README.md explaining:
  - Architecture
  - How matchmaking works
  - How WebRTC signaling works
  - Scaling strategy (Redis, horizontal scaling)

IMPORTANT
- Code must run inside Replit
- Avoid unnecessary libraries
- Write code as if this will be reviewed by a senior backend interviewer
- Focus on clarity, not shortcuts
